          “This book tells the story of Mary Frances, a little girl whose great
          ambition was to help her mother. So anxious was she to do this that
          even the humble Kitchen People became her teachers and instructors.
          They talked to her, a thing never heard of before; helped her over the
          hard places, and explained mysterious secrets she could never
          otherwise have understood.
        </p>

        <p>
          They wove around a simple little book of recipes her mother had made
          for her the spell of Fairyland; they led her through a series of
          delightful adventures such as never happened to any girl before, in
          which she lived for three whole happy weeks, and out of which she
          emerged no longer a little girl, but a real little woman.
        </p>

        <p>
          Some very wise people would call this a story book, some a manual
          training book, and others a cookery book, but Mary Frances knows
          better; she knows that it is a Book within a Book that introduced her
          to Aunty Rolling Pin and a lot of other dear, dear friends, such as no
          little girl ever had before, and whom she now wishes to introduce for
          the first time to all other little girls. In the hope that Mary
          Frances’ wish may be realized, this record of adventures is sent out
          to the girls of America with the best wishes of
